Version 1.6 - 4/4/2025

- Updated to Starsector 0.98a.
- Adjusted everything inline with the new codex system.
- Refactored, optimized and cleaned every scripts. (Thank you Alex for incorporating the SHU elements in vanilla!)
- Adapted the new item installation framework provided by the base game.
- The OP cost of SHU hullmods remains 0 but the installed items can still disappear if the ship gets disabled or destroyed in combat. (There's a toggle for this, turn it off if you wish.)
- Fixed existing bugs and typos.
- Added new toggle option to disable the mutual exclusivity of Special Upgrade and Armament Support System hullmods. (You can install all of them in one ship!)
- Added new toggle to enable Gacha S-mods which is basically a cheat toggle.
- Added new option to assign different hotkey for the subsystem of certain hullmods.
- Added new cross-mod interaction with the Sunrider mod. Biologic Commodity Replicator and Flux Hypershunt provides additional effect to the Sunrider ship.
- Added a pop-up prompt when purchasing the hullmod specs from Hubert.
- Removed the unintended hard dependency with LunaLib. It can function now without it.
