BeginConversation sphmu_hubert true true","As you approach, the man clenches his jaw, chugs his beverage, and slams his cup down on the table. The bartender sighs, refills the customer's drink, and, with a tired smile, motions for you to take a seat. Flustered, you sit down at the bar and order a drink while you subtly observe the angry man.

""32. That's all it had to hit. Fucking. 32. All my money, lost on a stupid bet... Where the hell am I going to get the money to get out of this place anyway? Shit...""

He picks up his refilled glass, grimaces, and takes a long gulp. He looks to his side and seems to take notice of you. His right hand reflexively moves down to the metal case on the stool next to him, and a hungry look appears in his eyes. You hear him whisper something under his breath, but you can't quite make it out. 

""Hey, you!"" He elbows you as you put your drink to your lips, almost causing you to spill. ""Moment of your time? I happen to have picked up something pretty interesting a little while ago. Might be of use to a spacer like yourself.""","introPTGamblerCont:""Explain.""",

!$SpecialHMODBarOffer",,"""Sure, sure... The name's Hubert Klein. I'm a Domain-tech researcher at the Galatian Academy. Technically, I'm on a business trip but, you see, I've got a bit of a weakness when it comes to casinos. Turns out Tri-Tach knows how to run a good establishment. So good, in fact, that I can't afford a ride back home."" He leans closer to you and whispers, ""Or my bar tab.""

""I decided take a little detour before heading back to the Academy. Maybe play the slots, a little blackjack; you know, something simple, easy to walk away from. And it went well! I hit the jackpot on the slots and got, well, maybe a little overconfident. I figured I'd take those winnings to the roulette table and see just how far I could push my luck.""

He suddenly frowns and kneads his brows. ""Gambler's fallacy, right? I'm a university professor! I should've known better. I made a couple of decent bets, made a little more money, drank a little more whiskey, and before I knew it I had all my money on 32. Ball hit 31. Shit.""","introPTGamblerOptions:""...and?""",

""This was supposed to be delivered to the Galatian Academy two days ago. Unfortunately, I can't afford a ship back, and my expense account got canceled yesterday. So, let's make a deal.""

""Inside this briefcase are several hullmod specifications developed by a joint Galatian Academy - Tri-Tachyon research team. The conclusion of the project? Well, we found out that we can use Domain-era technology to boost the performance of the Sector's warships. How?"" He rolls his eyes. ""Doesn't matter how. You don't have enough PhDs to understand how. Point is, this is valuable.""

""There is no way I still have my job. But I do have this briefcase. And you have money. How about... 100,000 credits for the whole thing? That asshole Baird is going to come after me regardless of what I do, so this should keep me safe, at least for now. Trust me when I say that this is worth way more than that â€’ I just need the money now or my ass is grass.""

You insert the keycard, enter the passcode, and the suitcase clicks open with an electronic chime. Fifteen neatly stacked hullmod specs lay in the briefcase. You scan each one with your TriPad to make sure they're real. Satisfied, you put the specs back and close the briefcase.

""See? I'm not lying. You saw what's in there. 100,000 credits barely scratches the surface of what those things are worth. You wont find those anywhere else in the Sector, either, so don't lose them. Or, do. Hell if I care. Just give me my money and we'll both leave happy."" He grins.

Say what you will about the greedy bastards, but no one makes a drink like a Tri-Tachyon bartender."" He reaches behind the barstool to grab his rolling suitcase and makes for the door before pausing and looking back.

""Oh, and Captain? Fair warning. Watch out for Provost Baird. If she asks you to do something, you'd better believe there's a catch."" He grimaces, looks toward the entrance of the bar, and looks back.

""Adios, Captain! May we never meet again."" He waves as he walks out the door.
