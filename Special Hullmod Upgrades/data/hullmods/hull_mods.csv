Pre-Collapse records indicate that the rarely-seen Zeroth Battlegroup specialized in large-scale siege warfare in operations with vital Domain assets on the line.

Nootropics, experimental ESP agonists and non-addictive formulations of several party drugs replace the stimulants and anti-nausea medication common to most combat drug delivery systems, vastly increasing crewmember unity, reaction time, and their desire for a challenging fight. Repeated usage of the drug cocktail is known to cause excessive competitiveness, a compulsion to train at all hours of the day, and intense irritability when the skills of the user's crewmates are questioned. Though objectively useful, its regular usage by ship crews is considered ethically problematic by the ethics committees of most factions, with the notable exception of Tri-Tachyon (who praise the system for its 'positive team-building qualities').",[REDACTED],graphics/hullmods/spuhm_eb_psyche_enhancer.png

Improved barrel rifling, energy collectors, and rail capacitors are installed in the ship's projectile weapon systems, improving projectile speed and armor penetration. In addition, loading systems are overtuned, dramatically increasing the ship's rate of fire.

N-brane geometry is used to modify the topology of logistics systems, increasing their storage capacity without any noticeable increase in ship volume. In addition, the ship's drive bubble is fortified with a local modification of physical constants, increasing the ship's apparent burn speed. These impressive logistical feats come at the cost of significantly increased upkeep. Many of the advanced mathematical theories required to understand and replicate these modifications were lost in the Collapse, but a gifted engineer may be able to replicate these logistical improvements from first principles.",[REDACTED],graphics/hullmods/spuhm_hga_premiere_logistics.png

Marketed toward speed-obsessed pilots, engine safeties are either stripped down or removed entirely, significantly boosting the ship's top speed and acceleration while enabling the ship to operate at cruising speed for longer than should be possible. This comes at the cost of an extremely hot, visible engine assembly and structural weaknesses in the engine housing. As a customer service consideration, the ship's cockpit is modified with additional speed-related controls and buttons, but they do not connect to the actual drive system; rather, they control a number of force-feedback functions that emulate the feeling of controlling an overtuned petroleum-fired ground transport vehicle.",[REDACTED],graphics/hullmods/spuhm_dynamic_engines.png

An attempt to revitalize the waning strike craft supremacy doctrine just prior to the Collapse, this hullmod applies efficiency and quality upgrades to the ship's nanoforges that improve fighter communication systems and weapons damage while decreasing the maintenance cost of individual fighter wings. While no replacement for the superior fighter doctrines of previous eras, Hunters In The Void was a welcome addition to the fleets of many carrier groups in the late Expansion Era. With the Collapse, this design was lost, but an enterprising flight deck engineer may be able to replicate its effects from first principles.",[REDACTED],graphics/hullmods/spuhm_orion_shipyards.png

Developed in a now-shuttered secret facility on Culann, extant scientific papers attribute this hullmod to K. Astraia working on behalf of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. The papers describing the hullmod's effects depict a near-complete optimization of phase space rupture technology, but lack instructions on how to perform the modifications. All references to the project disappear from Sector records after cycle 201, suggesting a sticky end for K.

Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem,specialsphmod_gacha_quantum_theory,6,0,Galatia Academy,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.SPGACHAQuantumTheory,"Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that are concerned with the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories. These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.

The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.

Employing a diagonal argument, Gödel's incompleteness theorems were the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. They were followed by Tarski's undefinability theorem on the formal undefinability of truth, Church's proof that Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable, and Turing's theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the halting problem.

The incompleteness theorems apply to formal systems that are of sufficient complexity to express the basic arithmetic of the natural numbers and which are consistent, and effectively axiomatized, these concepts being detailed below. Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called formal theories. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability within these systems, rather than about ""provability"" in an informal sense.

There are several properties that a formal system may have, including completeness, consistency, and the existence of an effective axiomatization. The incompleteness theorems show that systems which contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic cannot possess all three of these properties.",[REDACTED],graphics/hullmods/spuhm_quantum_theory.png
